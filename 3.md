**Diagram 2 Description:**

## Patent 1: Modular Isolated Execution Stacks with Hierarchical Zones, Decentralized Trust Management, and Capability-Based Inter-Component Communication

**Abstract:** This invention discloses a secure computing architecture featuring Modular Isolated Execution Stacks (IES), enhanced with hierarchical Zones, decentralized trust management, and path-based inter-component communication. Each IES provides complete hardware-enforced isolation, encompassing dedicated processing, memory, input/output (I/O), and networking resources, preventing unauthorized access and lateral movement of threats. Within each IES, child IES instances are organized into a hierarchy of sub-zones, each associated with a localized Trust Root Configuration (mini-TRC) defining trust roots and policies for granular control. Inter-child-IES communication utilizes a capability-enhanced Packet Carried Forwarding State (PCFS) mechanism, enabling flexible, policy-driven data sharing and resource access. A dynamic partitioning mechanism adjusts child IES instance configurations based on real-time demands and policies, optimizing performance.  A dedicated hardware Security Monitor enforces isolation and access control between child IES instances, while a distributed Resource Manager facilitates resource allocation based on zone-specific policies and resource availability, further leveraging a bandwidth reservation system for guaranteed resource access. This integrated approach establishes a robust and adaptable secure computing foundation.

This diagram illustrates Patent 1 (Modular IES) within a broader SecureSphere Endpoint context, demonstrating its integration with other key SecureSphere technologies.  The focus is on showcasing how multiple IES instances operate concurrently and securely within a single endpoint, each with dedicated resources and secure communication channels.

Endpoint Focus: The largest subgraph, "SecureSphere Endpoint," contains all components operating within a single endpoint device.  This provides context for the IES cluster.

Modular IES Cluster (Patent 1): This subgraph depicts the core concept of the patent:

IES Instances: Three IES instances are shown, each dedicated to a specific application (Web Browser, Email Client, Document Editor). This exemplifies how different applications can run in isolated environments. Parent IES (Dynamic Partitioning): This visually represents the capability of a parent IES instance to be dynamically partitioned into child IES instances, enabling granular control and flexible resource allocation. Hardware Resources (Dedicated per IES): Each IES instance has its own dedicated set of hardware resources (CPU, Memory, I/O, Network), enforcing strong isolation.

Secure UI Kernel (Patent 11): Shows the secure UI kernel, which allows user interaction with the isolated IES instances without compromising security.

HESE-DAR (Patent 24): The Hardware-Enforced Secure Encrypted Enclave for Data at Rest is included, demonstrating how data stored by each IES instance can be securely encrypted.

Inter-IES Communication (Patent 2): Shows the use of Data Diodes for secure, unidirectional communication between IES instances, preventing unauthorized data flows.

External Communication (Patent 3):  Illustrates the Firewall mediating external network access for the IES instances, ensuring secure communication with the outside world.

Master Security Mesh (Patent 2): The MSM provides security monitoring and oversight for all IES instances on the endpoint.

SecureSphere Hub (Patents 4, 16): Shows the Hub's role in resource management (Patent 10 is implicitly included) and policy enforcement via the Dynamic Trust Management System (DTMS).

Decentralized Ledger (Patents 13, 15): The ledger is shown as providing auditing and governance functions for both the Hub and the IES cluster.

**Description for Diagram 5:**

**System for Secure and Trustworthy Computation and Communication**

This diagram presents a novel SecureSphere system and method for achieving secure and trustworthy computation and communication across multiple isolated execution environments (IES) and zones, even in the presence of compromised components or hostile external actors.  The SecureSphere system leverages a combination of hardware-enforced isolation, dynamic trust management, AI-driven security adaptations, and multi-dimensional auditing to provide an unprecedented level of security and resilience.

**1. System Architecture:**

The SecureSphere system comprises several interconnected modules, as illustrated in the accompanying diagram. The core components are:

-   **SecureSphere Hub:** A central orchestration and management unit that oversees the entire system, managing resources, policies, and inter-module communication.
-   **Dynamic Trust Management System (DTMS):**  A distributed system responsible for establishing, maintaining, and updating trust relationships between IES instances and zones. The DTMS uses Trust Root Configurations (TRCs), dynamic trust metrics, decentralized zone management (DZMS), policy negotiation, and distributed consensus to manage trust dynamically and adaptively.  TRCs are stored on a decentralized ledger for enhanced security and auditability.
-   **Automated Evolutionary Software Development System (AESDS):** An AI-driven system responsible for the development, testing, and deployment of software for all SecureSphere components.  The AESDS incorporates an Isomorphic Architecture Monitoring and Adaptation (IAMA) module that monitors and adapts to threats originating from integrated legacy systems.  Software updates are deployed securely through authenticated channels and verified using TRCs before installation.
-   **Multi-Dimensional Audit Trail System (MDATS):** A system for comprehensive auditing, encompassing both digital logs (stored on the decentralized ledger) and physical tamper-evident 3D-printed microstructures, correlated and analyzed by an AI to detect anomalies. MDATS creates a multi-dimensional audit trail encompassing software provenance, hardware attestation, and operational events.

**2. Secure Inter-IES Communication:**

Secure communication between IES instances is achieved through a novel dual-channel architecture:

-   **Data Diodes:** Provide unidirectional, high-assurance communication for sensitive data transfers.
-   **Capability-Enhanced Packet-Carried Forwarding State (CE-PCFS):**  A capability-based communication protocol that grants fine-grained control over data access at the packet level.  Capabilities are dynamically assigned and managed by the SecureSphere Hub's Capability Manager, based on real-time assessments of trust, resource availability, and policy. The CE-PCFS utilizes hop fields encoding capabilities and policy information to allow for secure routing and access control, reducing reliance on central management.

The communication architecture incorporates a hierarchical security mesh (MSM) for real-time monitoring and anomaly detection within individual IES instances and across the entire system.

**3. Supporting Technologies:**

The SecureSphere system utilizes a variety of supporting technologies, including but not limited to:

-   Secure Boot
-   Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
-   Secure UI Kernel
-   Chiplet Architecture
-   Decentralized Ledger Technology

## Patent 3: Adaptive Multi-Channel Network with Declarative Policy Enforcement and Capability-Aware Forwarding

**Abstract:** This invention discloses a secure and adaptive multi-channel network architecture for physically isolated execution environments, specifically designed for systems utilizing Modular Isolated Execution Stacks (IES).  The architecture features dynamically configurable, physically segregated network channels, each dedicated to a specific security domain, communication purpose, or trust level, preventing cross-channel interference and data leakage.  A novel aspect of this invention is the use of declarative policies to define channel configurations, firewall rules, routing policies, and access control mechanisms.  These policies, expressed in a high-level language and stored on a decentralized, tamper-proof ledger, enable automated and auditable network management.  The architecture incorporates an out-of-band hardware firewall system, operating independently of the primary operating system and IES instances, providing dedicated firewall instances for each network channel with hardware-accelerated policy enforcement.  Furthermore, a capability-aware forwarding mechanism leverages capabilities embedded within hop fields of inter-IES communication packets (Patent 2), enabling fine-grained access control and dynamic traffic management based on trust levels, resource availability, and real-time security assessments. The inclusion of dedicated, isolated channels for legacy internet access ensures backward compatibility without compromising the security of the core network. This integrated approach creates a highly secure, adaptable, and efficient multi-channel network, enabling granular control, dynamic adaptation, and automated management while supporting diverse security requirements and legacy system integration.

## Patent 4: Dynamic Trust Management System (DTMS) with Decentralized Zone Management and TRC-Based Trust

**Abstract:**

This invention introduces a Decentralized Dynamic Trust Management System (DTMS) for the SecureSphere secure computing ecosystem, providing a robust and adaptive framework for secure collaboration and resource sharing within a physically segmented, multi-kernel, zoned environment. The DTMS establishes and manages trust relationships between Isolated Execution Stacks (IES) instances within and across Zones, leveraging distributed Trust Root Configurations (TRCs) stored on a tamper-proof decentralized ledger. The DTMS utilizes cryptographic identity verification, dynamic trust metrics, a distributed consensus-based validation mechanism, and declarative trust policies for fine-grained control. A Decentralized Zone Management System (DZMS) governs zone membership, inter-zone trust, and secure TRC distribution and consistency, utilizing a beaconing mechanism for efficient dissemination of TRC updates. Furthermore, a novel policy negotiation mechanism, enables zones to dynamically establish and agree upon shared trust policies, enhancing collaboration and adaptability. This integrated approach provides a secure, transparent, and resilient trust management system for dynamic and evolving workloads, mitigating the risks associated with centralized trust authorities and promoting flexible, zone-specific security configurations.

**Abstract:**

This invention presents a system for secure resource borrowing and granular I/O management within a secure, zoned computing environment utilizing Modular Isolated Execution Stacks (IES).  The system enhances resource utilization, security, and resilience by enabling IES instances to securely lend and borrow idle resources (e.g., processing power, memory, storage) while maintaining strict hardware-enforced isolation and adhering to trust policies defined in Trust Root Configurations (TRCs).  A hardware-enforced Secure Resource Borrowing Mechanism (SRBM), employing a PCFS-like mechanism with hop fields for efficient communication of requests and allocations, manages resource access.  Granular I/O management is achieved through a hardware-based Isolated I/O Gateway (IIG) incorporating a hardware I/O Switch Fabric and a Zero Trust I/O Handoff Protocol (ZTIOH) utilizing dynamically generated, cryptographically authenticated tokens and unique, verifiable IES identifiers for access control, strengthened with capability-based access rights. A Multipath Communication Manager (MCM) establishes and manages multiple secure communication paths for resource borrowing and I/O operations, optimizing for load balancing, bandwidth aggregation, and fault tolerance while integrating with the DTMS and capability system for enhanced security. Declarative policies, integrated with the DTMS and TRCs, provide flexible control over resource access, enhancing security and adaptability in dynamic computing environments. A Multi-Layered Virtual Console (MLVC) provides secure user interaction with multiple isolated IES environments, and contextual Input/Output Redirection Protocols route signals to the correct IES instance based on the active environment and TRC policies.

## Patent 11: Secure UI Kernel with Zonal Isolation, Hardware-Enforced Control-Flow Integrity, and Declarative Policy-Based Rendering

**Abstract:**

This invention introduces a secure user interface (UI) system for multi-kernel computing architectures, specifically designed for environments utilizing Modular Isolated Execution Stacks (IES). The system features a dedicated UI Kernel that operates in complete hardware isolation from the primary execution environments, ensuring that user interactions do not compromise the underlying system.  A key innovation is the treatment of the UI Kernel as a separate SecureSphere Zone, with its own Trust Root Configuration (TRC) and access control policies, enhancing isolation and preventing interference from potentially compromised IES instances.  The UI system employs a multi-region display buffer, with each region assigned a distinct, dynamically adjustable trust level, governed by declarative policies.  Hardware-based validation mechanisms, including checksums and digital signatures, ensure the integrity of content rendered in each region.  Furthermore, the UI Kernel incorporates hardware-enforced control-flow integrity (CFI) to protect against control-flow hijacking attacks, and critical UI Kernel services are implemented in hardware to minimize the trusted computing base (TCB).  A secure, unidirectional communication bus connects the IES instances to the UI Kernel, enforcing data flow control and preventing reverse communication attacks. This comprehensive approach provides a robust and secure UI system resistant to various attack vectors, including control-flow hijacking and display-related attacks, while supporting dynamic trust management and policy-based rendering.
